# Sample project to show some property wrappers
## Description
Here you can see the use of the following property wrappers:
- `@StateObject` used for objects
- `@State` used for values
- `@Published` used to track a property change

## Configuration
The `.gitignore` file is missing so some Xcode user folders will be created when you open this project, I am using Xcode **16.1 (16B40)** the last version from Apple Store at the last commit date; just open and run it.
